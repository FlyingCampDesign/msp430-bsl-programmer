EEPROM
======

The EEPROM that stores the FTDI device descriptors on the [MSP430 BSL
Programmer](http://www.flyingcampdesign.com/msp430-bsl-programmer.html "MSP430
BSL Programmer") can be modified by using the
[FT_Prog](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm "FT_Prog") utility
from FTDI Chip. The files in this directory can be used to restore the
programmer back to factory defaults.
